\title{Global Variables Declaration}
\description{
This script declares global variables to suppress notes about undefined global
variables during the package build process. These variables are used throughout
the package but are not defined in a way that R CMD check recognizes.
This declaration avoids the "no visible binding for global variable" notes.
